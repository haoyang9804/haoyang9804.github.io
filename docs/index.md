This is Haoyang Ma (马昊阳).

A PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST.

I hunt bugs in open-source software, contribute code to AI frameworks and compilers, and study high-performance computing.

I write papers for graduation, while I write [blogs](blog/blog) for fun.

Besides these hobbies that help me survive, 
I also enjoy music programming, [digital painting](play/paintings), and [in-game photography](play/games).


You can know more about me through my [resume](./resume.pdf),

<!-- , supervised by Prof. [Shing-Chi Cheung](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/). I'm now a member of the [CASTLE Group](http://castle.cse.ust.hk/castle/index.html). Before I joined in CASTLE Group, I did research on compiler bug isolation under the guidance of Prof. [Junjie Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/junjiechen08/) for more than one year when I was an undergraduate at Tianjin University. -->

<!-- I'm enthusiastic in **building robust software systems**.
On the way to achieving this goal, I have engaged into research topics including

+ **Bug Study**: *how to understand and categorize oceans of bugs*
+ **Bug Isolation**: *how to locate bugs*
+ **Fuzzing**: *how to detect bugs efficiently*
+ **Program Generation**: *how to generate valid test programs*

I'm also interested in leveraging <u>*translation validation*</u> and <u>*metamorphic relation construction*</u> to **validate** software systems.

As for engineering, I have been actively testing and helping maintain compilers for a while. These days, I'm helping fix [TVM frontend bugs](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ahaoyang9804). -->
