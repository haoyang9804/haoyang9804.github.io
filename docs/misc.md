I like painting using Wacom board, especially painting *pop art*. My avatar is drawn on **Clip Stdio**.

I also like writing Lofi music on **FL studio**, and I'm now learning how to write Cyberpunk2077 style music and remixing. Here is one of my works. It's trivial and simple.

I like watch football match, and my favorate football team is Liverpool F.C (YNWA!).
